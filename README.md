# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
A current look at all the employees near retirement and their current level
## Overview of Project
This project was created to determine the total retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to  participate in the mentorship program. First we analyze employees born between January, 1 1952 and December, 31 1955, then using that table. We can define how many employees at each varying level within the company is leaving. As seen here

Lastly we grouped together mentors that were born in the 1965 to set a standard for an age group that could begin mentorship for lower level and new staff members.

## Results
* Based on the results of retiring employees, we have lost a lot of senior staff and engineers recently and should hire or promote new ones.
* We should consider only fulfilling the mentorship roles with current staff in the Senior position as they will be filling the roles of the recent retirees
* Using the retirment_titles table, we can find how long staff members have worked at a position. We can ask people who have been in those positions the longest if they would like to mentor.
* We do not need to hire or promote any new managers currently as other roles must be filled.

## Conclusion
As the company begins to shift to a younger age demographic, we need to provide more mentorships so younger staff are prepared for their Senior roles more readily.
